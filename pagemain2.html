              First off are my parents. 
              They divorced when I was younger and they have absolutley no contact with each other, 
              but they are always there for my siblings and I. 
              They are both in new relationships.
              My dad lives in the AV, 
              so it can be difficult to make time to see him, but we keep in touch virtually. 
              My mom lives in the city so we constantly get together.

      <div class="hide">
          <p>Regardless of what they went through, they both stuck around and continued to provide. I am thankful to have them.</p>

          <p>My tia and tio on my dads side are (respectfully) my favorite family members, besides my siblings.
          My aunt is my dads sister and shes my dads only sibling that doesn't live in Mexico. 
          They honestly raised my sister and I for a year while my parents situated. I've learned so much from them both. </p>

                I couldn't have been blessed with better people.
                My siblings are thankfully all so successful.
                We all get along so well. 
                My youngest brother moved to Arizona last year and we hope to see him for Christmas.
